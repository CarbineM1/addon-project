#### Wave 1

<blockquote>
As construction of The Crypt gates come increasingly close to full completion, deprived souls have already begun seeping into the lobby and corrupting the natural landscape. 8 of these specters have been spotted inside of the game servers, seeking refuge inside of enemy players on the field. Slaying members of the enemy team has a chance of awarding you with a token, which, once you have collected all 8, can be submitted for an opportunity to be rewarded. When you receive one of these tokens, take a screenshot of it in your inventory, and once you have all 8, upload the pictures to an image hosting site (such as Imgur), and then complete this submission form. Details for prizes will be released soon.

#### Wave 2

<blockquote>
As the gates fully open, corrupted souls have freely entered the over world and cursed numerous maps with their tainted touch. The Horseman challenges your skills and invites you to his crypt where he has been prisoner for countless decades. Defeat him and you will be rewarded immensely. Over the next few days you have the opportunity to gather your friends and enter the Halloween dungeon, The Crypt, to test your skills and conquer the Horseman's army. Eight warriors are able to traverse The Crypt at a time. Right now the Crypt will be open frequently but as more players enter, the Horseman will grow tired and limit entry to only one group per hour. Defeat him and you will possess the power to transform yourself into the Headless Horseman while in the lobby with a new and exclusive Halloween gizmo! Additionally, victors will be rewarded with a Halloween trophy to show off. The rotations have also been updated. New maps added, old maps removed, but most importantly, Halloween themed maps have been added as well! You can find the complete details on the rotation update here.
