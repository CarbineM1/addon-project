Overcast Network, also known as OCN, was a popular Minecraft server running [PGM](wiki/history/pgm). On August 31st, 2016, OCN was acquired by the Lifeboat Network, which ran a successful Minecraft PE server. On January 20th, 2017, Lifeboat announced the closure of the Overcast Network in a move to their own plugin, Hampton. On Jan 28th, OCN was shutdown, 3 days earlier than was expected by the community, upsetting many players. Shortly after closure, PGM was open sourced under the AGPL. This allowed many servers to run their own version of PGM, including Stratus Network.
