#### Announcement and Beginning

On the 31st of January 2017, [ShinyDialga](ranks/administrator) announced that he would be starting a server using the recently open sourced [PGM](history/pgm), alongside ItzaMeLuigi and amactus. By the 4th of February, the server had implemented a rotation and accepted staff members, solidifying the server as a legitimate [Overcast Network](history/ocn) successor.

#### Merge & Early Development

On the 5th of Feb 2017, Shiny announced that the server would be merging with [The Equinox Network](history/equinox), adding Tazz to the administration team, as well as several other staff. On this day amactus also announced new [rules](https://stratus.network/rules/en) for the Server.

During February and March, several features were introduced including an autoclick detector, dynamic rotations, [donations](https://stratus.network/shop), a website, and in-game stats.

In April, Shiny announced Cloudy MapDev to the public and set way for the first April Fools day prank, in which the player count was set to 5000 in reference to Lifeboat.

In May, the [Mini Mapmaking Competition](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/contests/stratus/mini_map_competition) was announced. This was an effort to grow Cloudy and add new maps to the server. ItzaMeLuigi announced an [MVP system](gameplay/mvp) and added two new ranks to the shop. A [token system](gameplay/tokens) was created by then contributor cs_. Later that month the first tournament, [*Stratus: Return of the Gamemodes*](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/leagues/stratus/stratus_return_of_the_gamemodes) was announced.

#### Summer Events

In early June, the first batch of Moderator applications was opened and a lobby was set up to allow seamless movement between servers. Later in early July, ElectroidFilms, with help from cs_ and ShinyDialga, announced that Stratus now supported Minecraft versions 1.7-1.12.

The first batch of moderators was then announced, with Epicness, Vice, nixter1029, nintendoboy11, Shawnn and slayersource joining the staff team. Matic0b, Timothee38 and nixter1029 joined the web development team, and cs_, Raino and Shawnn were promoted to the role of developer.

In mid July brought the second Mapmaking competition, [DMC](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/contests/stratus/destroy_map_competition), as well as the announcement of new EU and AU connection proxies. By the end of July, this wiki was born, and amactus announced [internet famous](ranks/internetfamous) and [content creator](ranks/contentcreator) ranks.

#### Further Expansions

In early August, amactus introduced a new feature, Private Servers! These servers has customisable options for maps, player counts and datacenter location. Around that time, ElectroidFilms was promoted to Administrator, to lead the development team onwards. In September, Map Developer applications were opened, with Jexel, Antnecb, koipen & Matic0B being promoted. Private servers were also revamped to make them more affordable and stable, and 1.12 support was added.

The first mini event, [*Just Deserts*](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/events/just_deserts) was announced, as well as a new [website](https://stratus.network) feature by Matic0b, themes. The [XML documentation](docs.stratus.network) website was updated, and Pochinki won *Just Deserts*.
