Tokens exist on the Stratus Network in 2 forms, and can be obtained either in-game by playing, or via the [shop](https://stratusnetwork.buycraft.net/) by either buying them with rank or separetly.

#### SetNext Tokens

SetNext tokens are the first type of tokens, they can be used to suggest maps that are in the repostory to play next (Note: They do not have to be in the rotations!). To use a SetNext token, you can type `/poll next <mapname>` in chat. A poll will appear, and if the majority of players online agree with your suggestion, your suggested map will play after the map currently in play is done.


#### Mutation Tokens

Mutation tokens are the second type of tokens, they can be used to suggest [mutations](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/gameplay/mutations) for the next map. To use a Mutation token you can type `/poll mutation <mutation name>` in chat. Like SetNext tokens, a poll will appear. If your suggestion gets accepted, the mutation will activate on the next map. For a list of mutations you can either look at our mutation page, or do `/mt list in-game`.
