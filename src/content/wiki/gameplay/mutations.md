Mutations are a PGM feature which may be used to modify elements of a single match. Some examples of mutations are the Armor mutation, which gives players diamond armor, and the Health mutation, which gives players 10|Y extra hearts of health. Mutations only last for a single match, and may be enabled or disabled by staff members. Mutations can also be enabled through the use of a Mutation Token, which will create a poll for players to vote and decide whether or not to add a specific Mutation.

#### Kit-based mutations

This section lists mutations which are granted through kits.
