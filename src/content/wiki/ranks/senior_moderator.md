They are also responsible for the choosing and training of [Junior Moderators](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/ranks/junior_moderator). 

#### Requirements

Moderators who have proven themselves to be valuable assets can be chosen by Admins and pre-existing Senior Moderators to become a Senior Moderator.
