Moderators are a group of staff members that enforce the rules and keep a friendly atmosphere. They represent the order of the community, and are expected to uphold all of the rules, and to help others do the same.

#### Description

A moderator's main purpose to uphold and enforce order in the server by making sure that the rules are followed. They punish those who break them, and help keep the server, both in Minecraft and in Discord, a happy, fun and friendly place by reminding users to be nice. They also have various permissions allowing them to effect rotations.

#### Requirements

Next to the basic requirements of maintaining order and enforcing rules, a moderator is the voice of the community to the staff, and it is really important that moderators are mature, fair and approachable people. Moderators must follow the staff code of conduct. A moderator must be able to commit to spending a fair amount of time in-game, as well as always staying updated in Discord. They must be fluent in English.
