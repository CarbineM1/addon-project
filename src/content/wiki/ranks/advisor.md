Advisors are part of the former Overcast Network Development and [Administration](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/ranks/administrator) team. They are chosen to assist and guide the staff and the development team with their experience and knowledge on running the servers. They have operator permissions on the server.

#### Description

Advisors serve as the tutors for the administration and staff team. They help the staff keep the server running smoothly take on projects on their own. Despite them having operator permissions, they are not official [staff](https://stratus.network/staff). However, they may assist in moderation.

#### Requirements

Advisor is not a rank that can be obtained by applying, but rather given to a user if they held a very important position within the Overcast Network.
