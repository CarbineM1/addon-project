Official is the second rank within the event staff team.

#### Description

An Official has more responsibilities than a [Referee](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/ranks/referee), but less than a [Sr Referee](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/ranks/senior_ref). On top of the regular ref responsibilities, they are in charge of training Refs, and help to manage the ref team alongside the Sr Refs. They also lend a hand in writting tournament policies.
