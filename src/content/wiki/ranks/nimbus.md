#### Description

The Nimbus rank is very similar to the [Alto rank](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/ranks/alto). Players with this rank can fly in the lobby, choose their own team and a 2.0x [droplet](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/droplets) multiplier, although are not join full teams. Unlike the Alto ranks, players are also given 3 [SetNext tokens](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/gameplay/tokens) and 1 [mutation token](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/gameplay/tokens). This rank only lasts two weeks.
