Map Developers are the staff members in charge of creating and managing maps. A Map developer is very knowledgeable in either building, [XML](xml), or both.

#### Description

Map Developers manage everything in relation to maps, including rotations and other [map related events](https://mcresourcepile.github.io/addon-project/wiki/events). They look into map submissions in the [submissions sub-forum](https://stratus.network/forums/59ac44b7a2e3a9000100004b), working with the submitter to decide whether a map will get into the repo or rotation. To make sure that maps work well, map devs test submitted maps on their map-dev server. Users can always ask Map Developers for help if they need help with the XML for their map. They are in charge of making sure that maps work to their optimal functionality, and are the ones who are in change of fixing broken maps. They also manage the docs page.

#### Requirements

Applications are required to be promoted to Map Developer. These applications are considered by the Map Dev team, and should show the player's knowledge on XML, building, or both.
